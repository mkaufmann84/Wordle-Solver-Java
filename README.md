    TO USE: UNDERSTANDING HOW TO EDIT JAVA. GO INTO MAIN METHOD, AND EDIT THE STUFF AS FOLLOWING FOR THE p.solve(...)
    
    
    FIRST ARGUEMENT IN SOLVE IS CHARACTERS THAT CANT BE IN WORD. EVERYTHING LOWERCASE

    SECOND AND THIRD ELEMENT ARE TIED TOGETHER. THE INDEX MATCH UP SO THAT THE "KEY" in SECOND MATCHES TO THE POSSIBLE POSITIONS IN THE THIRD ARG.
    IF letter "a" IS BOTH GREEN IN THE FIRST AND THIRD LETTER IN WORD, and "w" is yellow on the last, THAN ADD:
    
    // inwordKey+="a"; inwordValue.add(new Integer[]{2});
    // inwordKey+="a"; inwordValue.add(new Integer[]{0});
    // inwordKey+="w"; inwordValue.add(new Integer[]{0,1,2,3});


    FOURTH ARGUEMENT IS IF A LETTER CAN NOT OCCUR TWICE, BUT IS IN WORD ONCE. 
    
    THE WORD RETURNS IS THE WORD THAT CROSSES OUT THE MOST OTHER WORDS BY LOOKING AT IF A WORD WAS CHOOSEN AND WRONG, THE LETTERS ARE NOW INVALID AND HOW MANY WORDS ARE NOW INVALID
